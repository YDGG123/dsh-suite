// Room cards: the ask_user and show_view cards a member shows in a group chat.
//
// A card asked inside a group belongs to the group, not to the member's hidden group
// Session: the group view looks it up by room id, and the answer goes back to the
// member that asked. The member's turn has already ended when the card appears (a tool
// cannot hold a DSH turn open), so "paused" means: the round marks the member's slot
// `waiting-answer`, the group carries on with everyone else, and the user's answer
// starts a new turn in the member's hidden group Session, whose output posts back into
// the group through the usual late-reply path.
//
// Cards live in `state.roomCards[roomId]`, ordered by when they were asked. A key card
// (request_secret) waits in `state.secretRequests` per Bot and is mirrored here under the
// same id, so the group dock can show it; the request stays the source of truth for who
// may use the key, and the mirror only for what the group is waiting on.
